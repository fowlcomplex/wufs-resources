## __**Fursuits / Furry Merch**__

Some special things to note for Fursuits / Furry Merch:

- When buying internationally, work out an agreement on customs (such as if your package gets lost/damaged)
- I would exercise further caution shipping from the US and Russia. Whilst there are lots of makers, the problem is Tariffs and Customs Fees means you often pay 1.5x-2x+ the amount quoted, as well as other risks such as the package possibly being damaged or lost.   
- If commissioning a fursuit, make sure to read through the seller's TOS otherwise they may reject you!
- Etsy tends to be unreliable as there's a lot of dropshippers now. Be careful and double check the merch/fursuit is really theirs!
- Ensure you take receipts and proof of agreement in the case of a chargeback. 

Just because you submit a commission or receive a quote, does not guarantee your suit will be made! Make sure to develop a relationship with the maker so that you work together to achieve both goals and get to know each other. 

These methods have tended to find the most success:

### In-Person Means
Attending FurMeets (ask suiters where they got their suit from)
Conventions (Artists Alley / Dealers Den)
Word-of-mouth (us at WUFS have a couple suits...)

### Online Means:
"Furry / Fursuits" Feeds on Bsky
#fursuits and similar hashtags on Bsky/Twitter
TheDealersDen.com (International maker agencies exist such as fox4, but I would apply the same caution as any other seller, make sure to read details completely!)
Twitter (a lot of makers/vendors still use Twitter)
Instagram/TikTok

Whilst Etsy, Ebay and Amazon are possible, I would discourage heavily relying on these and instead source the maker through alternative means to prove their authenticity. Be careful of scams and stolen works!
