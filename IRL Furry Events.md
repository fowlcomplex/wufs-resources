## __**Furmeets**__
BrumFurs (Birmingham) is the one we plan to frequent. 
CovFurs has been put on hold for the time being. 

For many UK meets (eg: NottsFurs), they will have their own telegram and/or bsky/twitter account. Make sure to snoop around as sometimes it can be word of mouth, and if lost, ask for help! 

You may need to verify upon entering (to prevent scams/bots), if so feel free to put me down as a contact/vouch as necessary and make sure to let me know so I do vouch for you!

## __**Conventions**__
Going to a convention is one of the most epic parts of furry expression.
Whilst amazing, it is best to do so with a lot of planning ahead of tiem to make sure you can enjoy it to the fullest!

UK Conventions:
- Scotiacon (Feb) 
- CFz / ConFuzzled (May)
- Wild North (Sep)

Other UK Stuff:
- LFSW / LondonFurs Summer Weekend (July) 
- Core Element Festival (Aug)
- UK PonyCon (Oct)

EU Conventions:
- NFC / NordicFuzzCon (Feb)
- EF / Euroference (Aug/Sep) 
- Furvester (Dec-Jan)

[List of US Conventions](https://furrycons.com/calendar/calendar.php?loc=us) (there's a lot). 

All of these are "relatively" well-attended and reputable cons. Ultimately, **you will** need to plan for months in advance, especially if you plan to book "Residential" (where you stay at the hotel/venue). 

Given these are paid and professional events compared to meets, updates will be circulated by a variety of means in the lead up, planning and during the Convention (Telegram Updates Channels, Bsky, their own websites). 

We plan as a society to go to ConFuzzled together, but don't let that stop you from venturing out and going to more!
