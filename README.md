# Welfare, Support and Self-Help Resources

## Foreword
This channel is designed to be filled with information about self-help resources, signposting, education and awareness so that you are equipped with the information and support necessary for whatever you may face.

As the Welfare Officer, I realise it would be ideal for this community to be able to access resources quickly and conveniently without having to wait or suffer in silence for someone, such as myself. This doesn't mean I won't be present, active and in-person to support you, but rather this is in addition to the services I can provide as well as being elected to help ensure your wellbeing and welfare. 

I want you to be empowered to your own success, both personally and as a member of WUFS. I believe this detailed channel filled with tons of information can prove helpful for many situations you encounter. Shoot me a DM if you need any help or would like a hand (or a paw...) with any help.
This will be written in mind for current University of Warwick students, the vast majority of our members, and as such will highlight Warwick specific services. However I will still signpost and highlight external services, and I imagine most of the guidance is applicable to all readers.

This has been added to Github to make it easier to access and accessible to those beyond the server.

I hope this serves as a comprehensive guide to accessing Welfare, Support and Self-Help Resources. Let me know as well if there's anything I can improve on too.
