# Flynt's Guide to Commissioning

To commission art, you need to decide what you want first: what characters do you want (e.g., your fursona)? What do they look like? What type of drawing do you want? At first this is going to seem like a monumental task, but fear not!

### How to buy?
Most artists use PayPal, but this doesn't mean you need to have a PayPal account. Often, artists can instead request payment, and you can use a debit/credit card, just like any other online transaction. Remember that most does not mean all: some use Stripe, CashApp, and so on. Some require an account, others don't.

### Deciding what you want
First, you should consider making your own character(s), if you haven't already.

**I don't know what I want my character to look like...**
If you're not sure what you want, you can look online for adoptables: these are character designs that artist sell onto people. Some of these are cheap, some are expensive, and some are auctioned. Make sure you read the description of any listings you come across.

**I know what I want my character to look like, but I can't draw them!**
Try anyway! First, have a look on FurAffinity (and similar websites) for free-to-use bases to create a reference sheet. You can then save these to your computer, then either make a design on your computer (Paint.net is a good application for this), or even print them out and draw by hand.

If you have any special patterns on your design, it helps to draw these separately first: they might look a little confusing if only shown on the character itself.

Once you've filled out one or two bases, you can then use these to commission art. It might help to first commission a reference sheet to work out any ambiguities and add anything else you'd like. For example, not many bases come with long hair, so you could fill in a base, and ask an artist to make the hair longer!

However, if you'd rather, some artists will take text descriptions and work with you to produce a character shaped by your imagination, but usually this will incur additional cost. Some artists may also accept images or "mood boards" to inspire the design.
​

## Deciding your piece
First, consider what you're looking for. Is there a certain scene you're picturing? Do you need a reference sheet? Are you looking to print stickers or make discord emotes?

Once you're sure, write down what you want. Answer questions like...

What is each character wearing?
What's the setting? City? Café? Or do you just want a plain background?
What is each character doing?
What props are there?

For a reference sheet, you might want to add details to your character, such as optional accessories, alternative hairstyles, typical outfit, etc.

The greater detail you can go into, the better your commission will turn out. Do some research to find the right terms if you have to! For example, I asked an artist to draw out my specific model of laptop, so I needed to find a picture of it!

Instead of "I want this character to have an ear piercing"...
Try: "I want this character to have a gold helix piercing on their left ear"

In fact, it's even better if you can sketch the drawing you're looking for, even if it's just crummy stick figures! Of course, for smaller pieces like emotes, headshots or YCHs (your character here), you won't need to worry so much about image-based references, except for that of your characters!

### An artist I really like is open, but I don't know what I want!
Sometimes, you might want to commission an artist more than you want to commission a specific art piece. If you're not commissioning a YCH, some artists may automatically take artistic liberty with their piece, but most will ask what you're looking for. If you completely don't care, some artists do pay-what-you-want (PWYW) commissions.

If you're really in a pinch, it really doesn't hurt to just make up a scenario on the spot! Try asking for a draw-over of a meme you like, for example.

## Finding artists
Artists promote themselves on a range of different platforms, and not all artists will use the same platform. Generally speaking, you'll want to look on social media for artists you like the look of, such as...

Instagram
Twitter/X
Bluesky (subscribing to feeds will present you with lots of artists to discover)
SFW Art Feed
N/SFW Art Feed (NSFW warning, obvs)
Reddit (try r/furry_catwalk, NSFW warning)
The ⁠art channel here!

Again, you may also want to look on FurAffinity. The Dealers Den (NSFW warning) is also a great place to find artists and commission openings, but you'll have to verify your account and pay a small fee to use the site.

Once you find an artist you like, check their bio and latest/pinned posts to see if they're open for commissions. If they are, their options and prices will usually be listed either on a personal website (typically a Caard), on a Kofi page or in a pinned post. If they're not open, or you're not sure, keep an eye on them by giving them a follow and waiting. There's no shame in asking when they'll next open for commissions, but don't pester for a response. Some artists don't offer commissions.

Make sure you check what they will and won't draw: some artists won't take character designs with complex patterns, for example. Please respect this and move on. If you're looking for an NSFW commission, remember to check if the artist allows them also. If they don't, again, please respect this and move on. If they do, there's usually an additional charge, this may be fixed or added as a percentage to the final bill.
If an artist you like is out of budget for you, or they're not open for commissions, try finding another! Remember that there are thousands of artists online, and chances are, you'll quickly find another one you like.

## Breaking the ice
So now you've found an artist, and you know what you want to get. Now it's time to reach out! First, check for a post outlining the commission process, or check the artist's website (if they have one). Make sure you'll be able to pay them, and read their Terms of Service, if they have them: usually this describes how their commission process will work, how you need to pay, turnover time, and what you can use the art for. Some artists will have restrictions against using other people's characters or using GenAI references for instance.

Once you're all set, there will either be a form you have to fill out where you provide contact info, your references and commission details, or you'll need to message the artist directly. If it's the latter, don't panic! Simply be friendly and tell the artist what you're looking for. Just make sure your message isn't just "Hi": try to open a conversation.

**Something like this:**
"Hi! I'm interested in commissioning a reference sheet for my character."

Be patient, and within a few days, you should hear back. If you've not heard anything after a week, try messaging again. After that, it may be time to move on.

If the artist has responded, you should have a little back-and-fourth as to what you're looking for, and make sure to give the artist any details they need, namely references, contact details and your PayPal (DON'T provide bank details!). Some artist may ask for payment upfront, others later on. Again, read the TOS. Once you're both on the same page, just sit back and wait!
​
### The grand reveal
Your artist will typically send you proof of progress as they work on your piece. This is your chance to make sure everything looks okay and make any corrections before it's too late. Don't be afraid to ask for any corrections. If there's a marking that looks slightly off, say so! You're not being rude or unappreciative, this is your money after all. Just mention it politely, and suggest how they could make the correction.

Something like this:
"No, the top of the forearm in both arms should be black. The idea is that edge goes halfway up the side of the forearm before curving just past the elbow, so i suppose here the marking would twist along the arm?"

If you've not heard anything for a while, don't be afraid to send out a message asking for the status of your piece. Also check their social media pages in case they're taking a break. If they are, please be respectful of this and wait: artists are human beings too, and sometimes they need to step back! There's nothing wrong with checking in after a few weeks and asking when they plan to resume though.

At long last, you'll get the final piece. Once you're completely happy with it, the artist will typically send you a link to a shared file where you can download it, but this depends on the artist and platform (some compress images as they're sent, so aren't in full quality). If you're not sure, ask! And make sure to keep the image safe, you paid good money for it after all!

Take another moment to read the terms of service to double-check what you can do with the art. After that, show off your awesome new art by posting it to your socials and tagging the artist! Maybe post it here while you're at it??
