## A word on Art

Furry artists, whilst everywhere, can be hard to find at first - especially if you're looking for a specific type of work or style. The main thing you'd want to headhunt is those who have "Commissions Open", meaning they are able to take your requests for artwork.

Be patient! It can be a while before you understand what you really want and what art style or niches you look for (such as me, with a cartoony Disney-style duck). Don't be afraid to pick up a sheet of paper and pencil yourself, even if you're terrible like me it's still really therapeutic being able to express your imagination.

Finding Art, Artists and Craft tends to be most successful via: 

***In-Person Means:***
- Attending FurMeets (there will often be an Artist Table)
- Conventions (Artists Alley / Dealers Den)
- Word-of-mouth
- Furry Society Events (we are fortunate to have a couple artists!) .

***Online Means:*** 
- "Furry Art" / "Furry" / "SFW Furry Art" Feeds on Bsky
- #furryart and similar hashtags on Bsky/Twitter
- TheDealersDen.com (All sellers and buyers have to pay to be verified, whilst this won't stop scams and bots it heavily discourages it)
- toyhou.se 
- Twitter (a lot of artists still use Twitter) 
- Instagram/TikTok
- #art channel here (and in other servers)!

Once you find an artist(s) you like, they will often have a linktree, caard, toyhou.se or similar allowing you to view all their socials and works, and deduce whether their commissions are open or closed. 
Remember - treat an artist nicely, and they'll treat you nice in return :3 

In addition to all of this, I would advise creating a toyhou.se account, this can help with transferring art or proving ownership of characters! EG: https://toyhou.se/soulbit (an artist).
